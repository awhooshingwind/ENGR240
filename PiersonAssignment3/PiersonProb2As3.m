% Problem 2: A catenary cable is one which is hung between two points not in the same vertical line. 
% It is subjected to no loads other than its own weight. 
% Thus, its weight acts as a uniform load per unit length along the cable w (N/m). 
% TA and TB are the tension forces at the end.

% Compare results
% Modified secant seems to be the most accurate 
% (at least compared to the plot visually and the built-in fzero function in Matlab 
% (both producing a root at ~1266. 
% The fixed point method takes longer since the slope of the function is relatively small, 
% it wanders around before zeroing in on the actual root, 
% whereas the Newton and secant methods, in this case, are able 
% to find the root more quickly â€“ since the slope is effectively linear over the guessing range,
% using tangential methods is efficient and effective.
% If the slope was more exponential or erratic, the Newton and secant methods would take longer to converge.
